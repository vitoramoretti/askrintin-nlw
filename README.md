# AsK.rintin

Ask Krintin is a project developed during the Next Level Week event by RocketSeat as is being developed in the Discover track as a way for me to solidify the foundation of my learning and feel a bit more prepared.

## About

You can check the original project here [rocket.q](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/nlw6-discover) to have an idea.

The main goal is to have a webapp where you can create a room for other people to make anonymous questions for your, or to ask questions for other people with the password provided.

## Day 1

This was a very tranquil project start. I created the main layout for the home page adding all the styles and images.

## Day 2

This was more about the other view such as the one for creating a room and the one for asking the questions. Still it was pretty much just layout and Front End stuff.
