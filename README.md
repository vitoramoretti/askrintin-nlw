# AsK.rintin ❔

Ask Krintin is a project developed during the Next Level Week event by RocketSeat as is being developed in the Discover track as a way for me to solidify the foundation of my learning and feel a bit more prepared.

## About

You can check the original project here [rocket.q](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/nlw6-discover) to have an idea.

The main goal is to have a webapp where you can create a room for other people to make anonymous questions for your, or to ask questions for other people with the password provided.

## 📔 Day 1 

This was a very tranquil project start. I created the main layout for the home page adding all the styles and images.

## 📔 Day 2

This was more about the other view such as the one for creating a room and the one for asking the questions. Still it was pretty much just layout and Front End stuff.

## 📔 Day 3

It was definetly a shorter activity. It was for finishing the layout for the room and addind a modal to be prompted when deleting a message. Basically HTML and CSS so far.

## 📔 Day 4

Today was fun! We finished the modal for when deleting or marking question as read. We initialized the Node project along with Express for the routes and EJS for the view engine. We were also able to create Controllers for the routes. In the very end we created and connected to a SQLite database for creating the rooms.
It was a great class for sure and made me connect a lot of dots. 🚀

## 📔 Day 5

Finished but with lots of room for improvement. There are lots of features that could be added here to make the project a bit more interesting. But we were able to complete all the functionallity in the system and it's great! I'll probably use this repo as a testing area and who know, I might even deploy to the web to get some feedback from the community!
